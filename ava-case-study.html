    <h2>About The Project</h2>

<div class="case-study-text">
    <p>As part of my application I had been asked to pick out of three options to design for my application. The options were; design a t-shirt which would be on sale at AVA 2019, design a stage set up for AVA 2019 or design a social media campaign.

    I chose the social media campaign to work on as I thought it gave me the most room to be creative. </p>

    <h2>The Situation</h2>

<div class="case-study-text">
    <p>Before sketching or even going onto Illustrator I decided to do some research into their previous social media posts.

    From my research I was able to construct an idea of their aesthetic and brand guidelines which I wanted to follow through into my own work. 

    Once I had constructed my research into their previous social media campaigns, I began sketching layouts of different features of the campaign. I decided I would design an annoucement poster, set lists poster, a cover photo for the events page and two ticket warning posts.</p>
