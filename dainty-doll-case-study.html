    <h2>About The Project</h2>
</div>
    
<div class="case-study-text">
    <p>As my final assignment at Northern Regional College I was asked to approach a local business and offer a full rebrand. This was to be completed in groups of two or three. My team consisted of Laura and I, which worked out perfectly as we both had very similar design styles. The client that Laura and I chose was Dainty Doll nail salon located on the Antrim Road.</p>

    <h2>The Situation</h2>
</div>
    
<div class="case-study-text">
    <p>Dainty Doll lacked a strong solid brand to represent itself as a business, which wasn’t helping it stand out amongst the many nail salons in Belfast through their social media. They had multiple versions of their logo which was diluting their brand. The photographs that they took of their nails was inconsistent and created a ‘messy’ feel across their feeds. Another thing Dainty Doll lacked was stationary for their business, they didn’t have any business cards, price lists or vouchers. </p>

    <h2 >The Process</h2>
</div>
    
<div class="case-study-text">
    <p>Laura and I decided to divide up the tasks for the rebranding, for we could both fairly work on different elements of the project. We both have very similar design styles so always knew how to help each-other if one was struggling.</p>

    <p>Cliodhna, the owner of Dainty Doll only really had one requirement for us when it came to designing the logo, that she wanted to keep the back to front ‘DD’ from her original logo. At the start Laura and I struggled with the idea of how we could try refresh and make something new out of something so simple as two back to front D’s. We decided that ‘slicing’ the D’s would be the best method.</p>

    <p>Throughout the design of the stationary and social media posts we wanted to create a really tight brand that flowed really well. We kept the colour scheme to blush pink and emerald green to create a really classy look.</p>
